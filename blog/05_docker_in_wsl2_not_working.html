	<h1>Docker in WSL2 not working</h1>
	<p>
		I have recently installed WSL2/Ubuntu. Following general instruction for docker@Ubuntu I had an issue that docker is not working. The problem was that docker service was not running. systemctl is not available in WSL2, so you need to use init.d:

		<i style="margin-left: 20px">> sudo /etc/init.d/docker start</i>
	</p>

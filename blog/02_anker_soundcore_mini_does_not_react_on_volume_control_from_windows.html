	<h1>Anker Soundcore Mini does not react on volume control from Windows</h1>
	<p>
		Recently I had an issue with Anker Soundcore Mini Bluetooth speaker. Windows volume level was not working with it. Only volume level 0 worked. Any other level just unmuted the speaker.
	</p> 
	<p>
		When changing the volume from the anker it worked and volume on Windows was also changed.
	</p>
	<p>
        Here is how I was able to fix it:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Change the value of <b>HKLM\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Control\Bluetooth\Audio\AVRCP\CT\DisableAbsoluteVolume</b> to 1
            </li>
            <li>
                Restart Windows
            </li>
        </ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		Side effect is that the volume control on the anker does not synchronize with Windows.
	</p>

	<h1> Troubleshooting WSL2 installation </h1>
	<p>
		Installing WSL2 in recent Windows is straightforward. According to documentation running <b>ws2 --install</b> in elevated mode should install WSL2, download recent Ubuntu image and restart the machine. My installation finished without asking for reboot. So I rebooted the machince myself.
	</p>
	<p>
		Then you should be able to find Ubuntu in start menu. In my case there was no Ubuntu there. I was confused what went wrong. Started checking list of installed images. Finally it was clear that for some reason Ubuntu was not downloaded. So I opened Microsoft Store and installed Ubuntu from there.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now Ubuntu is in the start menu and can be run from there. Also just invoking <b>wsl</b> from command line will run Ubuntu image (as there is no other images installed).
